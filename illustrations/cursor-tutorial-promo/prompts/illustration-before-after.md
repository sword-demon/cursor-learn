Learning Experience Transformation - Before vs After

Layout: split left-right comparison with center arrow

Flat vector comparison with split layout. Clear visual separation.

LEFT SIDE - "Before" (Coral tinted, slightly chaotic):
- Scattered English document icons with question marks
- A confused developer silhouette with swirl above head
- Disconnected video player icons
- Random article snippets floating
- Label: "零散学习" with subtitle icons: "英文文档 | 无法动手 | 缺乏系统"

CENTER DIVIDER:
- A large bold arrow pointing right
- Small sparkle effects around the arrow
- Text: "→" or transformation symbol

RIGHT SIDE - "After" (Mint tinted, organized):
- A clean organized interface showing the tutorial website
- A happy developer silhouette with lightbulb above head
- Connected module cards in a neat grid
- Progress bar showing completion
- Label: "系统学习" with subtitle icons: "中文教程 | 交互练习 | 进度追踪"

COLORS: Left side warm Coral (#E07A5F) tint, Right side cool Mint (#81B29A) tint, cream background (#F5F0E6), black outlines
ELEMENTS: Bold icons, simplified silhouettes, centered divider arrow, decorative dots

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.

Include a subtle watermark "@wjstar" positioned at bottom-right with approximately 70% visibility.
