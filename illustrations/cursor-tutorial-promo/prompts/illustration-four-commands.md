- Bottom-Left (Purple): "Ctrl+L 聊天" - A chat sidebar with AI avatar and message bubbles. Label: "对话式编程"
- Bottom-Right (Green): "@-mentions" - An @ symbol with connecting lines to file icons, code blocks, and document icons. Label: "上下文引用"

Each quadrant has:
- A large shortcut key badge at the top
- A simplified illustration of the feature
- A short Chinese description label

Center: A small Cursor logo or code editor icon connecting all four quadrants.

COLORS: Cream background (#F5F0E6), Blue (#4A90D9) for Tab, Coral (#E07A5F) for Ctrl+K, Purple (#7B68AE) for Ctrl+L, Green (#81B29A) for @-mentions, black outlines
ELEMENTS: Geometric simplified icons, rounded rectangles for quadrants, thin divider lines

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Main elements centered.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
