Each step is a rounded rectangle with an icon on top and Chinese label below. Steps are connected by thick coral-colored arrows flowing left to right in a gentle S-curve path.

A small "START" badge at the beginning and a "DONE" star at the end.

COLORS: Cream background (#F5F0E6), steps alternate between Coral (#E07A5F), Mint (#81B29A), Mustard (#F2CC8F), Deep Blue (#3D405B), black outlines on all elements
ELEMENTS: Rounded rectangles, thick arrows, simple icons per step, small decorative dots along the path

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Main elements centered.
