Interactive Coding Learning - Concept Visualization

Layout: centered with surrounding elements

Flat vector illustration infographic. Clean black outlines on all elements.

FOCAL POINT: A stylized developer figure sitting at a desk with a large monitor showing a code editor interface. The screen displays colorful code lines with an AI suggestion popup.

SURROUNDING ELEMENTS (floating around the monitor):
- A glowing Tab key icon with code completion arrows
- A Ctrl+K badge with an edit pencil icon
- A chat bubble icon representing Ctrl+L dialog
- An @ symbol with connecting lines to file icons
- Small sparkle/star decorations suggesting AI magic

COLORS: Cream background (#F5F0E6), Coral Red (#E07A5F) for primary accents, Mint Green (#81B29A) for secondary elements, Mustard Yellow (#F2CC8F) for highlights, Deep Blue (#3D405B) for code elements
ELEMENTS: Geometric simplified icons, no gradients, playful decorative elements (dots, stars, small circles)
TEXT: "Interactive Learning" in large handwritten-style font at top. Chinese text "交互式学习" as subtitle.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.

Include a subtle watermark "@wjstar" positioned at bottom-right with approximately 70% visibility.
